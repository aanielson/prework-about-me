      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm currently a secondary education teacher in Nebo School District. This is my second year teaching, and I currently teach 7th grade English and Reading, as well as an elective computer science course. After running the junior high's "Girls Who Code Club" and teaching the "Creative Coding" classes, I've decided to further pursue web development rather than continuing with teaching!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Mesa, AZ, and attended Brigham Young Univeristy in Provo, Utah for my bachelor's degree. My husband's family lives in Heber, Utah, so we end up spending time there too.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I consider myself a health and fitness enthusiast. Growing up, I competed in all sorts of sports ranging from dance to swimming to tennis. Today I stick more to weight lifting. I also enjoy reading, as well as playing videogames on my Nintendo Switch.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'd really love to become a full time web developer!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Orem and work in Spanish Fork.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'd like to build upon the skills I gained from my Digital Humanities Minor at BYU. From my 2 years of teaching experience, I realized that I love collaborating with a team, but I don't necessarily love managing a class of thirty twelve-year-olds. I also love being creative!</p>
